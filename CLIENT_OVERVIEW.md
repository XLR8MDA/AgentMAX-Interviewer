# AgentMAX — AI-Powered Interview Assistant

## How It Works

### For the Candidate

1. **Join the Interview** — The candidate opens a link in their browser. No downloads or sign-ups needed.
2. **Grant Permissions** — The browser asks for microphone access so the AI can hear them. Camera is optional.
3. **Have a Conversation** — AgentMAX greets the candidate warmly and begins a natural, relaxed conversation covering key professional topics.
4. **Interview Wraps Up** — Once all topics have been explored, AgentMAX thanks the candidate and ends the session with a friendly closing.

The entire experience feels like speaking with a real interviewer — not filling out a form or answering a chatbot.

### For Your Team

- Set up the interview once, and AgentMAX handles every candidate consistently.
- Interviews follow a structured protocol covering professional strengths, how candidates handle challenges, career goals, motivation, and more.
- All conversations are private. Session data is automatically cleared after each interview.

## What the Interview Covers

AgentMAX naturally explores these areas during the conversation:

- **Introduction** — Name and contact details
- **Professional Strengths** — What the candidate does best
- **Handling Challenges** — How they deal with workplace disagreements, stress, and feedback
- **Career Goals** — Where they see themselves heading
- **Motivation & Work Style** — What drives them and the environment they thrive in
- **Candidate Questions** — Giving the candidate a chance to ask their own questions

Questions are asked one at a time in a conversational flow — not read off a rigid checklist.
